2. Minimum of one [Service](/systems/webprint/service) Instance - PHP Application running as a service on a local server which downloads print jobs from [Server](/systems/webprint/server) and pushes them to connected printers.
3. Client applications - end user apps connecting to server using [API](/systems/webprint/api). There is [PHP Library](/libraries/webprint-client) for easy integration.
