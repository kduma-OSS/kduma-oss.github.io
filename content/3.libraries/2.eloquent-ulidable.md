# Eloquent ULID-able

Eases using and generating ulid's in Laravel Eloquent models.

## Setup
Install it using composer

```bash
composer require kduma/eloquent-ulidable
```

## Prepare models
Inside your model (not on top of file) add following lines:

```php
use \KDuma\Eloquent\Ulidable;
```

In database create `ulid` string field. If you use migrations, you can use following snippet:

```php
$table->ulid()->unique();
```

## Usage
By default it generates slug on first save.

- `$model->regenerateUlid()`{lang="php"} - Generate new uuid. (Remember to save it by yourself)
- `Model::whereUlid($ulid)->first()`{lang="php"} - Find by ulid. (`whereUlid` is query scope)
